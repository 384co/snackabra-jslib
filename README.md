## About

For documentation see:

* <https://snackabra.readthedocs.io> (latest)
* <https://snackabra.io> (archive of version 0.4.3)

Source and related projects: <https://github.com/snackabra>

## Build

```bash
# first time:
yarn install

# build and watch:
yarn start
```

## Usage in browsers

Directly in your html:

```html
  <!-- this will bring the minified version to "SB" -->
  <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/snackabra"></script>

  <!-- or dynamic import -->
  <script>
    import('https://unpkg.com/snackabra').then((sb) => {
      // do something with sb ...
    });
```

You can also access the loaded functions globally, e.g. ``window.SB.str2ab('hello')``.

From a local copy:

```html
  <script type="module" src="snackabra.js"></script>
```

## Usage in Node

This is dated, we do not prioritize node. Deno is the future.

Install:

```bash
npm install snackabra -g
```

A couple of ways to load ES module version in nodejs:

```javascript
// method 1:
import * as sb from 'snackabra';
console.log(sb.str2ab('hello'));

// method 2 (the default export)
import Snackabra from 'snackabra';
console.log(Snackabra.str2ab('hello'));

// method 3
const sb = await import('snackabra');
console.log(sb.str2ab('hello'));

// method 4
import {str2ab} from 'snackabra';
console.log(str2ab('hello'));
```

## Development and Publishing

```bash
# first time around remember to:
yarn install

# build components
yarn pack

# if needed
yarn login

# if you have credentials
yarn publish
```

Package should get updated at <https://www.npmjs.com/package/snackabra>
